    <h1>James Orson - X - HCI Prototypes</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        Thanks for looking at my Human-Computer Interaction prototypes! I have
        decided to consider a redesign of how to handle user interactions on
        social media platforms like X. Below are two prototypes for alternative
        views to display this to the user. These prototypes are based on the current circumstance
        where you are looking at the settings for someone you already follow, and do not mute or block.
        <br /><br />
        The first is a <a href="/descriptors">"descriptors"</a> design, being a novel design.
        <br /><br />
        The second is a <a href="/features">"feature"</a> design, using the existing concepts of the
        platform.
        <br /><br />
        Once you have familiarized yourself with the interfaces, please consider taking the survey:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are from Georgia Tech, take the survey <a
            href="http://peersurvey.cc.gatech.edu/gt/448aa0e2e3ad4993a413611ecbec14a5"
            > here</a
          >.
          </li>
          <li>
            and otherwise, if you are not from Georgia Tech, take the survey <a
            href="http://peersurvey.cc.gatech.edu/s/448aa0e2e3ad4993a413611ecbec14a5"
            >here</a
          >.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/descriptors/">Link to Descriptors Prototype</a> - Use plain language to
        describe the actions desired by the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/features">Link to Features Prototype</a> - Use ubiquitous, accepted
        "feature" terminology to describe the actions desired by the user.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>

    <h1>James Orson - X - HCI Prototypes</h1>

    <div>
      <p>
        Thanks for looking at my Human-Computer Interaction prototypes! I have
        decided to consider a redesign of how to handle user interactions on
        social media platforms like X. Below are two prototypes for alternative
        views to display this to the user.
        <br />
        The first is a "descriptors" design, being a novel and overall new design.
        <br />
        The second is a "feature" design, using the existing concepts of the platform.
        <br />
        Please take the following survey 
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/descriptors/">Link to Descriptors</a> - Use plain language to describe the actions desired by the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/features">Link to Features</a> - Use ubiquitous, accepted "feature" terminology to describe the actions desired by the user.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
